## Setup

I'm a PhD student in Pharmacology at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.

My research focuses on applying LC/MS metabolomics to the study of folate-resistant neural tube defects, and the potential role of small-molecule metabolism in the development of birth defects.


Thanks for reading!
