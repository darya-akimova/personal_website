## Setup

Hello! I'm Darya Akimova, a PhD student in Pharmacology at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.

My research focuses on applying LC/MS metabolomics to the study of folate-resistant neural tube defects, and the potential role of small-molecule metabolism in the development of birth defects. As I've learned R and transitioned more into the computational side of metabolomics, I became more interested in bioinformatics and data analysis in general.


Thanks for reading!
