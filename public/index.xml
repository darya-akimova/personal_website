      <description>Hello! I&#39;m Darya Akimova, a PhD student in Pharmacology at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences.
My research focuses on applying LC/MS metabolomics to the study of folate-resistant neural tube defects, and the potential role of small-molecule metabolism in the development of birth defects. As I&#39;ve learned R and transitioned more into the computational side of metabolomics, I became more interested in bioinformatics and data analysis in general. This website was created using the R package blogdown in order to share some of my work.</description>
